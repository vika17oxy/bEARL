"""Runner for RTAB-Map (Viktoriia Ovdiienko).

Copied by tools/register_system.py. Every runner has the same interface, so the
pipeline does not need to know anything about the individual SLAM system.

Contract - after run() returns, `out_dir` must contain:
    trajectory_tum.txt   estimated trajectory, TUM format: "t x y z qx qy qz qw" (t in seconds,
                         same clock as the ground truth), pose of the robot/camera in the map frame
    map.<ext>            the map / reconstruction: .ply or .pcd (point cloud), .pgm + .yaml (grid)
Raise an exception if the system fails (lost tracking, crash). The failure is then recorded
as an unsuccessful run - never silently retry or drop failed runs.

You may run the system any way you like (pip package, Docker, ROS 1/2, CUDA). Run it
OFFLINE so that every frame is processed (accuracy must not depend on machine speed).
